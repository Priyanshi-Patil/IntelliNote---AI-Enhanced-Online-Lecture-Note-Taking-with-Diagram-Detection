IntelliNote - AI-Enhanced Online Lecture Note-Taking with Diagram Detection

IntelliNote is a web-based application designed to revolutionize online lecture note-taking. It transcribes YouTube videos in real-time 🎥➡️📝 and detects diagrams or flowcharts embedded within the content 🔍📊. By leveraging AssemblyAI’s API for accurate transcription and the YOLO model for robust diagram detection, IntelliNote provides a seamless and efficient way to capture both spoken and visual information.

Key features include:

Real-Time Transcription: Converts audio from YouTube videos into text instantly.
Diagram Detection: Identifies and extracts diagrams/flowcharts using a deep learning model.
Multilingual & Customizable Summaries: Integrates Google Translation API to offer transcriptions in multiple languages with summaries tailored to user preferences 🌐📝.
Automated Organization: Automatically saves transcripts, summaries, and detected images to a user-specified folder for easy access 📁✨.
The application uses a tech stack that includes Python, FastAPI, MySQL, and Websockets for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, along with FFmpeg to process video streams. Future enhancements will focus on improving transcription accuracy, expanding diagram detection capabilities, and refining the summarization features 🚀.
